Backend scripts
- check-backend.sh — quick health check for /healthz and /api/ping with diagnostics
- diagnose-backend-ssm.sh — run SSM diagnostics/repair against the EC2 backend host

Note: scripts remain at repository root under scripts/ for compatibility; this folder documents backend-related ones.
