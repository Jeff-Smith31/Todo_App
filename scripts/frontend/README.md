Frontend scripts
- cors-test.sh — CORS preflight/health probe from a given Origin against the backend
- link-frontend.sh — DEPRECATED (frontend no longer uses S3/CloudFront). Served by Nginx on the backend EC2.

Note: scripts remain at repository root under scripts/ (and infra/scripts) for compatibility; this folder documents frontend-related ones.
