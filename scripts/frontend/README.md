Frontend scripts
- cors-test.sh — CORS preflight/health probe from a given Origin against the backend
- link-frontend.sh — Link S3/CloudFront frontend to backend (writes config.js and invalidates CloudFront). See infra/scripts/link-frontend.sh.

Note: scripts remain at repository root under scripts/ (and infra/scripts) for compatibility; this folder documents frontend-related ones.
